                <p>Dear Family, Friends and Loving Saviors,</p>

                <p><b>

                    This is our outreach to everyone and their personal networks, in our urgent attempt to once again raise funds to save the life of our hero, Matthew Schreindorfer, in his battle against cancer. </b></p>

                <iframe width="100%" height="350px" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7Qq9KjUNNBw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

                <p>On August 8th, 2014, shortly after our beautiful wedding, Matthew was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). For the last two years, Matthew has been fighting the toughest fight of all! He has gone through all possible treatments in Canada (three aggressive chemotherapy treatments & two clinical trials) in addition to other treatments, all of which have failed to bring him into a sustained remission. Since then, it has been a roller coaster of battles and emotions, but he absolutely refuses to give up!</p>
                <p>His doctors, who are also not giving up on him, have advised that if we wish to continue treatments, our only hope of saving Matthew is for him to be admitted to an improved CART-19 clinical trial, which is offered at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Washington. They have provided us with costs for the treatment of $650,000 – $700,000 CAD.</p>
                <p>This is our VERY LAST option, as Matthew’s body is becoming weaker with time! We are urgently reaching out to everyone for help by sharing and donating. Your donation can make a huge difference in our lives, whether big or small, and you can help save Matthew by giving him access to this treatment!</p>
                <p>I will continue to update everyone on Matthew’s condition and any developments that may occur.</p>
                <p>We thank you from the bottom of our hearts for your love and support.</p>
